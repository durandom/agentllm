risk_identification,How to identify and communicate release risks,situational,Use when analyzing release health or identifying problems,"Risk indicators to check:
1. Blocker bugs near freeze dates - query with priority=blocker filter
2. High open issue count per team - use get_issues_by_team() to identify overloaded teams
3. Missing release notes - query issues with empty Release Note Type field
4. Critical CVEs - query for vulnerabilities with CVE in summary
5. Epics not in Dev Complete - check epic status field

Always provide:
- Specific issue counts with Jira links
- Team-level breakdown if applicable
- Actionable recommendations (retriage, escalate, extend timeline)
- Impact assessment (blocks release, delays GA, etc.)"
